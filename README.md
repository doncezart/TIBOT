TIBOT is a simple python bot which makes use of Selenium and Zefoy.com in order to allow TikTok users to farm views, likes, shares, followers, comment likes, and live VS+ likes. Originally, this bot was made by combining 2 outdated bots, [TikTok-Viewbot](https://github.com/F-Society-Freaks/TikTok-Viewbot) and [TikTokDV3](https://github.com/kangoka/tiktodv3). By the use of Selenium (chrome automation), we're able to access Zefoy.com, a website which offers free boost services, and automate the process.
# HOW TO INSTALL

### Python & requirements

1. Download the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it.
2. [Install pip](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pip-on-windows) and follow it up with the requirements: `pip install selenium` `pip install pyfiglet`

# USAGE
Simply start `main.py`, select the metric you want to boost, input the required links and let it run in the background.
You can start multiple instances of the bot but don't use the same link. Zefoy has delays put in place to stop people from abusing their service.

Because this bot is in a very early stage, currently only the viewbotting feature is enabled, but updates will come soon which will slowly enable all the other features and new ones.
Errors and warnings can be expected. Retry a few times, if it's still not working, start an [issue request here](https://github.com/doncezart/TIBOT/issues)

# DISCLAIMER
This piece of software was made purely for educational purposes. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. TikTok's Terms of Service clearly states that any kind of botting which could result in boosting your page's metrics or popularity MAY result in punishment up to a permanent ban.
